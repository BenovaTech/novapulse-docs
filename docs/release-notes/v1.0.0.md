## New features
 
### Audio ingestion
Upload audio files in MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, or OGG format via
`POST /v1/audio/ingest`. Files up to 500 MB are supported.
[Documentation](../api-reference/audio-ingestion.md)
 
### Transcription with speaker diarization
Automated, speaker-attributed transcription with ≥90% accuracy.
Transcripts include per-segment timestamps, speaker labels, and
confidence scores. [Documentation](../api-reference/transcription.md)
 
### Sentiment analysis
Per-segment and per-call sentiment scoring with ≥85% reliability.
Scores range from -1.0 (strongly negative) to +1.0 (strongly positive).
[Documentation](../api-reference/sentiment-analysis.md)
 
### PII detection and redaction
Automated detection of names, phone numbers, email addresses, and
account numbers. PII is redacted in stored transcripts by default.
Configurable per API request via the `redaction` parameter.
 
### Webhook notifications
Pass `webhook_url` in any ingest request to receive a POST callback
when processing completes. Eliminates the need for polling.
